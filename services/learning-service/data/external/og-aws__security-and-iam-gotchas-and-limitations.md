# AWS Guide: Security and IAM Gotchas and Limitations

-	❗**Don’t share user credentials:** It’s remarkably common for first-time AWS users to create one account and one set of credentials (access key or password), and then use them for a while, sharing among engineers and others within a company. This is easy. But *don’t do this*. This is an insecure practice for many reasons, but in particular, if you do, you will have reduced ability to revoke credentials on a per-user or per-service basis (for example, if an employee leaves or a key is compromised), which can lead to serious complications.
-	❗**Instance metadata throttling:** The instance metadata service has rate limiting on API calls. If you deploy IAM roles widely (as you should!) and have lots of services, you may hit global account limits easily.
	-	One solution is to have code or scripts cache and reuse the credentials locally for a short period (say 2 minutes). For example, they can be put into the ~/.aws/credentials file but must also be refreshed automatically.
	-	But be careful not to cache credentials for too long, as they expire. (Note the other dynamic metadata also changes over time and should not be cached a long time, either.)
-	🔸Some IAM operations are slower than other API calls (many seconds), since AWS needs to propagate these globally across regions.
-	❗The uptime of IAM’s API has historically been lower than that of the instance metadata API. Be wary of incorporating a dependency on IAM’s API into critical paths or subsystems — for example, if you validate a user’s IAM group membership when they log into an instance and aren’t careful about precaching group membership or maintaining a back door, you might end up locking users out altogether when the API isn’t available.
-	❗**Don't check in AWS credentials or secrets to a git repository.** There are bots that scan GitHub looking for credentials. Use scripts or tools, such as git-secrets to prevent anyone on your team from checking in sensitive information to your git repositories.
